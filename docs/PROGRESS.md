## Known Issues & Challenges
1. Need to implement proper error boundaries
2. AI service fallback needs more robust implementation
3. IndexedDB schema needs optimization for large datasets
4. Mind map visualization performance needs improvement

## Resources & Dependencies
- Node.js & npm
- Vite + Vitest
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Dexie.js
- TipTap Editor
- HuggingFace AI API
- Testing Libraries:
  - Vitest
  - Testing Library React
  - JSDOM

## Notes
- Currently focusing on core functionality and stability
- AI features will be implemented incrementally
- Need to maintain focus on offline-first capabilities
- Consider migration to newer packages for better performance
- Regular security audits needed for Chrome extension compliance

## Questions & Decisions Needed
1. Confirm approach for handling offline storage and sync
2. Decide on specific AI provider and integration strategy
3. Determine testing strategy and coverage requirements
4. Decide on state management approach (Context vs. other solutions)

## Resources & Dependencies
- Node.js & npm
- Vite + Vitest
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Dexie.js (pending implementation)
- React Flow (pending implementation)
- Testing Libraries:
  - Vitest
  - Testing Library React
  - JSDOM

## Notes
- Currently focusing on core infrastructure and basic functionality
- AI features will be implemented after core functionality is stable
- Need to maintain focus on performance and offline capabilities throughout development
- Testing infrastructure is now set up with Vitest instead of Jest for better Vite integration
- Need to update react-flow-renderer to the newer reactflow package
