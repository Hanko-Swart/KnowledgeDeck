## Known Issues & Challenges
1. Need to resolve Node.js version compatibility warnings
2. Need to set up proper build process for Chrome extension
3. Need to implement proper error handling throughout the application

## Questions & Decisions Needed
1. Confirm approach for handling offline storage and sync
2. Decide on specific AI provider and integration strategy
3. Determine testing strategy and coverage requirements

## Resources & Dependencies
- Node.js & npm
- Vite
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Dexie.js (pending implementation)
- React Flow (pending implementation)
- Jest + React Testing Library (pending setup)

## Notes
- Currently focusing on core infrastructure and basic functionality
- AI features will be implemented after core functionality is stable
- Need to maintain focus on performance and offline capabilities throughout development
