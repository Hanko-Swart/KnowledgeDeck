- [ ] Create data models and schemas
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations

### 3. UI Components
- [ ] Create base component library
- [ ] Implement folder structure UI
- [ ] Add card component with basic functionality
- [ ] Set up drag-and-drop infrastructure

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create initial test suites for core components
- [ ] Add integration tests for main workflows
- [ ] Set up E2E testing environment

### 5. Features to Implement
- [ ] Basic bookmark management
- [ ] Folder organization
- [ ] Note-taking interface
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Web clipping tool
- [ ] Mind mapping visualization
- [ ] AI integration (placeholder structure)

## Known Issues & Challenges
1. Need to resolve Node.js version compatibility warnings
2. Need to set up proper build process for Chrome extension
3. Need to implement proper error handling throughout the application

## Questions & Decisions Needed
1. Confirm approach for handling offline storage and sync
2. Decide on specific AI provider and integration strategy
3. Determine testing strategy and coverage requirements

## Resources & Dependencies
- Node.js & npm
- Vite + Vitest
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Dexie.js (pending implementation)
- React Flow (pending implementation)
- Testing Libraries:
  - Vitest
  - Testing Library React
  - JSDOM

## Notes
- Currently focusing on core infrastructure and basic functionality
- AI features will be implemented after core functionality is stable
- Need to maintain focus on performance and offline capabilities throughout development
- Testing infrastructure is now set up with Vitest instead of Jest for better Vite integration
