  - Add folder creation/editing UI

## Next Steps

### 1. Core Extension Structure
- [ ] Set up background service worker
- [ ] Create basic popup/sidebar UI structure
- [ ] Implement content script for web page interaction

### 2. Storage Layer
- [ ] Set up IndexedDB with Dexie.js
- [ ] Create data models and schemas
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations

### 3. UI Components
- [ ] Create base component library
- [ ] Implement folder structure UI
- [ ] Add card component with basic functionality
- [ ] Set up drag-and-drop infrastructure

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create initial test suites for core components
- [ ] Add integration tests for main workflows
- [ ] Set up E2E testing environment

### 5. Features to Implement
- [ ] Basic bookmark management
- [ ] Folder organization
- [ ] Note-taking interface
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Web clipping tool
- [ ] Mind mapping visualization
- [ ] AI integration (placeholder structure)

## Known Issues & Challenges
1. Need to resolve Node.js version compatibility warnings
2. Need to set up proper build process for Chrome extension
3. Need to implement proper error handling throughout the application
4. React-flow-renderer package is deprecated, need to migrate to reactflow

## Questions & Decisions Needed
1. Confirm approach for handling offline storage and sync
2. Decide on specific AI provider and integration strategy
3. Determine testing strategy and coverage requirements
4. Decide on state management approach (Context vs. other solutions)

## Resources & Dependencies
- Node.js & npm
- Vite + Vitest
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Dexie.js (pending implementation)
- React Flow (pending implementation)
- Testing Libraries:
  - Vitest
  - Testing Library React
  - JSDOM

## Notes
- Currently focusing on core infrastructure and basic functionality
- AI features will be implemented after core functionality is stable
- Need to maintain focus on performance and offline capabilities throughout development
- Testing infrastructure is now set up with Vitest instead of Jest for better Vite integration
- Need to update react-flow-renderer to the newer reactflow package
