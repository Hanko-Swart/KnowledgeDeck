    - Utility-first approach matches project needs
    - Excellent developer experience
    - Built-in dark mode support
    - Highly customizable
    - Strong community support
    - Easy production optimization
  - Additional Considerations:
    - Use @apply for common utility combinations
    - Implement custom theme based on provided color palette
    - Set up PurgeCSS for production builds

## Mind Mapping Visualization
- **Recommended: React Flow**
  - Advantages over D3.js:
    - Native React integration
    - Better performance with React's virtual DOM
    - Simpler API for our use case

    - Robust API
    - Excellent documentation
    - Strong community support
  - Alternative Options:
    - Cohere: More cost-effective for text analysis
    - HuggingFace: Open-source alternatives
  - Implementation Approach:
    - Abstract AI service behind interface

    - Implement caching for cost optimization

## Testing Infrastructure
- **Recommended: Jest + React Testing Library**
  - Implementation Strategy:
    - Set up as we develop new features
    - Focus on critical path testing
    - Implement E2E tests for core workflows
  - Key Areas:
    - Component rendering
    - User interactions
    - Data persistence
    - AI integration points

## CI/CD & GitHub Actions
- **Recommended Actions:**
  1. Code Quality:
     - ESLint checks
     - Prettier formatting
     - TypeScript type checking
  2. Testing:
     - Unit tests
     - Integration tests
     - E2E tests on key workflows
  3. Build & Deploy:
     - Automated versioning
     - Chrome Web Store deployment
     - Release notes generation
  4. Security:
     - Dependency scanning
     - Code security analysis
     - Bundle size monitoring

## Pre-commit Hooks
- **Recommended Setup:**
  - Lint-staged for running linters
  - Prettier for code formatting
  - TypeScript checking
  - Unit test verification
  - Bundle size checking

## Development Workflow
1. **Initial Setup Phase:**
   - Set up Vite with TypeScript
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Implement basic extension structure
   - Set up IndexedDB with Dexie.js

2. **Core Feature Implementation:**
   - Basic bookmark management
   - Folder organization
   - Drag-and-drop functionality
   - Note-taking features

3. **AI Integration Phase:**
   - Set up AI service abstraction
   - Implement auto-tagging
   - Add summarization
   - Enable similar content search

4. **Advanced Features:**
   - Mind mapping visualization
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Offline synchronization
   - Web clipping tools

## Next Steps
1. Initialize project with Vite
2. Set up TypeScript and React
3. Configure Tailwind CSS
4. Create basic extension structure
5. Implement core storage functionality with IndexedDB

## Version Control Strategy
- **Branch Strategy:**
  - main: Production-ready code
  - develop: Integration branch
  - feature/*: Feature branches
  - bugfix/*: Bug fix branches
  - release/*: Release preparation

- **Commit Convention:**
  - feat: New features
  - fix: Bug fixes
  - docs: Documentation
  - style: Code style changes
  - refactor: Code refactoring
  - test: Test cases
  - chore: Build tasks, etc.

## Documentation Strategy
- **Recommended Structure:**
  1. README.md: Project overview and setup
  2. CONTRIBUTING.md: Contribution guidelines
  3. ARCHITECTURE.md: System architecture
  4. API.md: API documentation
  5. JSDoc: Inline code documentation
